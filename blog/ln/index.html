                        <p> September 12, 2020 üò≥</p>
                       <p><i>Definitely not my birthday today...</i></p>
                       <p>
                        Honestly, I‚Äôve kind of lived my entire life as a blob. A <b>fat</b> blob üò¨, but also a blob that didn‚Äôt really have a direction to go in. Or maybe no magnitude, or a combination of both. But definitely a blob.</p>
                        <p>Think about it:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Ages 0-5 is unconscious</li>
                            <li>5-10 is ‚Äúfight with parents about piano‚Äù</li>
                            <li>10-13 was ‚Äúbe edgy teenager and try to be cool in middle school‚Äù, which obviously failed</li>
                             <li>13-14 was ‚Äúget used to high school‚Äù. </li>
                         </ul>

                         <p><b> This year was 14-15, and I feel (a little bit) less blobby.</b></p>

                        <p>In fact, this is probably my first goal writeup of all time. So it‚Äôs probably going to be packed with shittybrik content.
                        First year of high school was pretty much like middle school? Pretty lame though. honestly bored. </p>
                        <p>In retrospect, my entire life has been me either being sad or being stuck up.  But mostly stuck up to cover up that sad. That‚Äôs for another story.</p>
                        <p>What I wanted to talk about today was my goal to being a blob. Because I‚Äôve had enough of being a blob.</p>
                        <p>I‚Äôve spent an obscene amount of üïó watching ‚ÄúGoal Setting‚Äù ted talks, but everyone knows that‚Äôs just procrastination. Nevertheless, I‚Äôd like to summarize some things that I have epiphanized from the talks.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There will always be a shadow, it‚Äôs up to you to step out of it.</li>
                            <li>You will always be üóë so why not make more people trash</li>
                            <li>The only thing that you control is what YOU do. <b>You don‚Äôt get to control how hard the problems on contest day are; you don‚Äôt get to pick if they are graph or dp; you don‚Äôt get to pick your üß†; you don‚Äôt get to pick how other people score.</b> All that you can do is to do the best with what you have.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>My favorite epiphany is from Professor Neko, but also the universal theme of hard work between all smart people helped me absorb the third point. (üëã tmw)</p>
                        <p> With this mindset, I don‚Äôt have an objective goal for anything this year. <b>All I know is that I want to get out of my current, comfortable mold of a blob, and want to push myself both physically and mentally to do something that I genuinely love (USACO). </b> Plus, everything is subjective, but whatever. </p>

                    <h3 class="title">Day 0</h3>
                    
                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p> October 17, 2020. </p>
                        <p>Honestly, I don't know why I'm restarting writing blogs.<p>
                        <p> It's not as if I can go write a blog, and suddenly I'm going to improve. But honestly going with the "flow" is literally nonsense for me, I don't touch USACO when I'm in a fucking flow.</p>      
                        <p> But, over the past 2 months, of being "relaxed", the following things have happened:</p>    
                        <ul>
                            <li> Parents call me lazy</li>
                            <li> I think I am lazy</li>
                            <li> I start up a trash tutoring service</li>
                            <li> I didn't improve</li>
                            <li> Even Brian Dean wants me to get better</li>
                            <li> I also really want to make camp this year and its not happening with the flow</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Honestly, I really love USACO but I also hate it so much when it's hard. I don't know how to perservere. Everyone around me: CodeTiger, Fishy15, even Elephant who's so bunched up with school work, are accelerating like rockets.</p>
                        <p> Just looking at your decision to do Edgenuity, what was it all for? Did you do it to make some nonsense money? Did you do it to waste around, watching youtube? <b>Or did you do it because you had a dream, and you wanted to work for that dream?</b> It's stupid to have no school and do nothing with that time. I really thought you were better than that.</p>
                        <p> Well, this is your first day. But more like an introduction. Day 0. </p>
                        <p> I think some important things to note on your odyssey:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Don't Dwell on Your Failures. Move ON.</li>
                            <li> It's OK to ask for help</li>
                            <li> Reading Editorial > Quitting</li>
                            <li> William Lin is still better than you</li>
                            <li> <b>If you want it enough, you'll work hard enough.</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> I think, all in all, I've learned a lot from my first intensive thing, and it was really hard. Now, I know its way easier said than done, but still. I believe in you. Just, don't give up. Don't let me (and BDean) down.</p>

                       <p>Okay, official "TMW Training", or more formally, "Torture Training". Day 1.</p>
                       <p> Firstly, for the fun part: here's my new desktop :)</p>

                            <p>I have a crush on him :/ </p>

                        <p> Okay, well that's all the fun stuff today.</p>
                        <p> I'd say, you did okay. It was actually really fun to solve IOI 2019 Shoes, and I'm still kind of an a happy-high right now. Like, damn, it's an IOI problem, from recently!</p>
                        <p> But, don't get ahead of yourself, haha. Your skill right now is still a 5.5-6.0 kind of thing, definitely not camp level yet.</p>
                        <p>I don't feel really different or really depressed or anything. I think the true art of TMW Training is honestly enjoying it. I know that tommorow, or some day later, I will be very sad and say "i cant solve anything", but I don't think that day is today.</p>
                        <p> Well, I guess it's probably important to deal with failures in a good way.</p>
                        <p> Then again, how can you do that?</p>
                        <p> Eh, whatever, oh well.</p>
                        <p> I guess I'll just do more problems tomorrow? It honestly feels kind of odd, having nothing bad to report on. Just, bliss. Such a weird feeling.</p>
                        <p> Regarding my social life:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> I spent about 30m editing William's Photo</li>
                            <li> Anthony Kung is gay</li>
                            <li> I wasted like 1h talking to Anthony today smh</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Yea, I guess I do have nothing to write about. That's all for Day 1!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="title"> Day 2</h3>
                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p> October 19, 2020</p>
                        <p> It's currently 2:30PM, and I only solved TypePrinter, a problem that I debugged for hours because <code> endl</code> is slower than <code>"\n"</code></p>
                        <p> Other than that problem, I haven't done anything else. And moreover, how do you "improve" fast? Like, am I even improving?</p>
                        <p> Well, actually, this question is pretty bullshit, so I'm going to hopefully not answer it. If I do, then you know I'm failing.</p>
                        <p>Okay, so I have 2 options now:</p>
                        <ol> 
                            <li>Solve Linear Garden</li>
                            <li>Go outside and cry</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p> I'm currently leaning to #2, but maybe that will change</p>
                        <p> Okay, update, 10:30PM</p>
                        <p> <b>As expected with ALL of your stupid DP problems, you were lazy and didn't fucking solve it</b></p>
                        <p> I'm honestly so disappointed in you, you spent 20 minutes watching a CP Guru video and you didn't actually solve problems -> the best way to get better.</p>
                        <p> Think about it like a fitness program. You can watch, read, listen, to all the tutorials in the world, but it's not helping you if you don't do it. <b> You aren't doing it.</b></p>
                        <p> Okay, enough with the "think about" bullshit. Just fucking do it. Like, why are you so annoying?</p>
                        <p> This was my day overview</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Solve Typewriter</li>
                            <li> Eat Lunch</li>
                            <li> Attempt Linear Garden -> Watch YT for 5 hours</li>
                            <li> Retry Linear Garden -> fail</li>
                            <li> Watch Galen Colin's "Roadmap" video</li>
                            <li> Be sad at how fast he improved, red in 1.5 years, even though I know I've gone down this fucking rabbit hole so many times it's stupid. <i> You know what, just fucking listen to Fishy, he's right. Others' successes don't undermine yours.</i></li>
                            <li>Be sad.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Day 2 of TMW Training is kind of a flop. You did 2.5 hours today, which is pretty decent, but also kind of trash.</p>
                        <p> See you tommorow. </p>

                            <p>My life is literally always just: solved problem? Yay. Didn't solve? Go to hell.</p>
                            <p>Accompanied with a stupid B- in Calculus from fucking Unit Summaries, I'm not feeling too good today. </p>
                            <p>Even then, what do I need to feel good? You're never satisfied. But you also never fucking put in the necessary effort to achieve your dreams. You are a joke. You are a a fraud. </p>
                            <p> Like seriously, if you genuinely want to be as great as William Lin, why don't you put in the effort that he did? You claim you have the passion, you claim that you're <i> always so busy</i>, you even claim that you'll be able to make camp this year, but where's the fucking evidence? Where's the proof behind the passion? <b>I didn't see you persist through Linear Garden today. Is that passion, or is it an infatuation?</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>You can look at all the successful people, or you can look at Fishy, or you can look at other smart people. What they all have in common is that they have passion. They love what they do, even if it's tough. They persist. What about YOU?</p>
                            <p> Do you even have passion? On paper it's so easy to say yes, but sometimes I even think the answer is no. Real passion comes from a heart-burning desire to get shit done, not a far-fetched dream of wanting to be great in a subject you've only touched for 1 year.</p>
                            <p> Quite frankly, I'm confused about you too. You always seem so hyped up about it, when you talk to your friends you give off this impression that you fucking love it, but deep down we always have to write this paragraph out. What's fucking wrong with you? Why do you say that you love it but you never actually execute it?</p>
                            <p> So ask yourself: <b><i> do you love it?</i></b></p>
                            <p> No saying "I love it when it's easy or when I'm improving, and I hate it when I'm not"; we both know that you improve everytime you solve a problem, not when you gain rating or however you measure your artifical growth. <b>Let's be honest, if you genuinely love it when you improve, you should do all the problems you can. Seriously. Solving a problem means you've improved, even if just by a tiny margin.</b></p>

                        <p> October 20, 2020</p>
                        <p> Honestly you're literally a brick. You want to be like William Lin, but you clicked on one of his videos, and then are now feeling sad about it. Like, I don't get it. Why are you sad? What the fuck?</p>
                        <p> You're literally a brick. Well, now. Usually you're fine when you see other people get good scores. Like, who cares? But when your <i> favorite person</i> is doing well, or posts a video, or something like that, you just go all crazy and then have stupid emotions. There's nothing rational about being angry he posted a video (and made $150 off of it) (ok, i guess not, but I don't feel angry that other youtubers make more than 150 per video).</p>
                        <p> Or maybe that somebody went into your bubble, and popped your fallacy of <i> I can do this at my own pace, and this has nothing to do with youtube</i>.</p>
                        <p> Also, there's like, no point in being angry. It's just your stupid jealousy. Honestly, smh. </p>
                        <p> When you practice by yourself, you don't feel demotivated at all, its just you, you, and you. Everything is you. </p>
                        <p> The moment you click on a William Lin video, that bubble is popped, and you realize there are people wayyyyyyyyy better than you, that even make money off of it. </p>
                        <p> Then, you want to be like that person who's wayyyyyyyy better than you, so you try. But you fail. Because you're looking at the results. You're looking at him being wayyyyyyyy better than you and even making some money off of it. <b> You're not looking at how much time, how much dedication, he put into it. How he too, also practiced by himself, in his own bubble, where it's just him, him, him. </b>
                        So maybe if you look at it from that way, maybe you can go back to your bubble, where it's just you, you, you.</p>
          
                        <p> Well, it's 9:30 PM now, and I spent a LONG time talking to Anthony about my stupid issues. Literally, I've spent 30 minutes deciding whether or not to message William, who I somewhat falsely claim to be my friend: like, what kind of a friend are you if you can't even talk to them normally? </p>

                        </div>
                        <p> Oh, my gosh. I pretty much fainted at 9pm... that's not even close to my bed time. After sending the message and dealing with life, I was tired and just started snoozing right away. üò≥</p>
                        <p> Honestly, I'm tired of ranting. I'm tired of dealing with this "abusive relationship" with CP. It's just... tiring. I have no more interest in writing how I feel, or my dreams, or how my dreams are shit, it's just, lackluster. There's nothing to it.</p>
                        <p> <b> I just want a break, from life. </b> And that's 75 years away. There are no rest-stops in life. It's still a competition, and I keep losing. I never can do something so well, and I thought CP would be my thing, but, oftentimes, I think it's not. Like, William Lin didn't go doubt himself. All the best people don't doubt themselves because they knew they were great. I'm doubting myself. For a brief while, I thought, me too. I could be great too. But there's just so much pain into being great that sometimes it's tiring. Like now. </p>
                        <p> I know that this sounds really weird, but sometimes I feel comfort in the sad. Being all excited and happy just feels, odd. And bad. There's just something about always putting yourself down, that makes you keep doing it. It's almost as if it's an addiction. Because honestly, when you're happy, it's shortlived, and then the sadness is a plague. And now I feel happy when I am sad. And I cannot be excited, or possess any of the happy emotions. Just, sadness.</p>

                        <p>
                        I was in a consulting session with my pet cow, William, and I think he made a bunch of good points.</p>
                        <p> You making IOI isn't up to you. You can try all you want, but at the end of the day there is a bottleneck. Everyone has a bottleneck. You will never be Terrence Tao, William Lin, but you will be a better <b>shittybrik</b>. </p>
                        <p> Comparing yourself to the best doesn't make sense. It's quite stupid, to be frank. You don't go and say "I want to be Rafael Nadal", and if you aren't improving like him, you go and quit. The only that's changed for you is your passion for it. You weren't passionate about Tennis. But I believe you have passion for CP. It's just being funneled in the wrong areas. </p>
                        <p> If you can channel your passion for CP into solving diffcult problems and perservering through them, you will be great. At least that's what my pet cow said. </p>
                    
                        <p> Uhhhh, its been like, 8 hours, and I didn't do anything. Nothing further needs to be said. Just, I don't know. I give up?</p>

                  <h3 class="title">Day 5</h3>
                    <div class="section-content">
                   <p> October 26, 2020</p>
                   <p>William Lin is literally a bitch. And I keep falling for it. Like, fuck that.</p>
                   <p>There's a charisma that "he's your friend" or whatever bullshit you bought into, but let's just be real here, you aren't, and you will never, be his friend. Okay? It's absurd to think anything else would be the case. </p>
                   <p>Well, I decided to just remove him, at this moment, probably an act of impulse, but whatever. It's not like he did anything anyways. Okay?  </p>
                   <p> Well, I guess for future you, here's what happened. I got hooked on this idea that William Lin was my friend. He's not, and never will be. Unless he decides to be friends with me, not me always chasing him around, because frankly, it's just so fucking tiring. I don't want to be in an interview relationship. And maybe this is what it means when the underdog doesn't want to be friends with the successful? But honestly, the successful is being a bitch. I'd love to see Jermaine be massively successful, and hopefully he won't go and be a bitch too.</p>
                   <p> I guess you were kind of cold. Whatever. It's not like anyone cares about you.</p>
                   <p> Yay, at least at the end of the day, you were productive. </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="title">Day 6</h3>
                    <div class="section-content">
                   <p> October 27, 2020</p>
                   <p> I'm in a dillemna. Yesterday, I removed William Lin as a friend. I decided to do this, one, as it was an act of impulse, but also William Lin doesn't treat me like a friend. I dedicate so much time and value to what he has to say, but I definitely know it's not a two way street. To him, I am probably a nuisance. </p>
                   <p> I said I'd come back, that I would talk to him in a year, or when I do become good. I know, good sounds really dull, but seriously. If you've seen William Lin with his other friends, he spends hours talking with some random person called SecondThread, Nick White, etc. He chats far more often with Mikey. So I guess you can call me jealous, but honestly, if William Lin isn't going to treat me like other people, then I don't want to talk to him. </p>
                   <p> Look, I get it. From his side, I'm just another fervent fan that will worship whatever he does. I will <b> never </b> be a friend. And it hurts, but I think it was necessary to understand this for anything to go on. He says he's busy but the amount of time chatting with other people has been far greater than me. He's always online on discord, and I can't even get a response from him? What? </p>
                
                   <p> So when I got a notification from Discord today, that William Lin would like to be my friend again, I was overcome with emotions. <i> Why? Is he actually my friend? Is he going to apologize or something? What is going to happen?</i> For the most part, I really wanted to still wait a year, get good, and then come back with a "rising up" story. Maybe he'll accept me as a smarter person then. </p>
                   <p> Anyways, the friend request was shocking. Before, I thought with 100% certainty that he didn't care about me. Now, he has the time to friend request me, but not reply? </p>
                   <p> I think a big reason why I value William Lin is because he's the first really smart person I met, that was nice to me. He was the only person who wished me happy birthday this year. Overall, on the surface, he seems like a really cheerful person that is also very sociable.</p>
                   <p> Okay, I know what you're thinking. I'm jealous of him because I have a crush on him? No. That's bullshit. If you were in a friendship where the entire time, you are objectively worse than the other friend, and furthermore, the friend takes an entire day to respond, you'd be pretty angry too. </p>
                   <p> To make matters worse, William's response to my conversation starter has always been a conversation ender. Our conversations feel like an interview. <b> And I'm tired. Fucking tired of it. Of being treated like a lesser friend.</b> So it's all or nothing. Either I'm going to stop being in a interviewing friend relationship, or the relationship isn't going to be an interviewing one.</p>
                
                   <p> Back to the friend request. I saw it and was a bit happy, that at least he cares, even if a little bit, about me. But now I had an option. To accept, deny, or ignore.</p>
                   <p> I obviously wanted to ignore it. Then, when I became "great", I can talk to him as an equal. But the discord red badge was really annoying.</p>
                   <p> If I accepted it, I would show that I was weak, that William Lin won me over, and that I could not think for myself. A benefit however, is that you could still forge a friendship with him. But at the end of the day, what the fuck does a friendship with William Lin do, if you aren't making the IOI? </p>
                   <p> If I didn't accept, I would lose out on William Lin's friend request, and we wouldn't talk for a year or more. This would lead to a really broken friendship, and I doubt we would still be friends after it. But, hatred and resentment is a very powerful motivator, and I did feel empowered the day after removing William Lin from my friends list. </p>
                
                   <p> After a long while of self debate, I finally chose to accept him on my friends list. I finally chose to accept him on my friends list. To me I felt that having him on my friends list would be a good source of support if I needed it, plus, maybe he would apologize and we just fix things for the better. That he would actually care. About me. For once.</p>
                   <p> Simply put, that didn't happen. It was a fantasy. A fantasy where you got on a call with your idol. A fantasy where your idol cared about you. A fantasy where your idol talked to you like a friend. <b>And the sad part is, all of these shouldn't be fantasies, if your idol was genuinely your friend.</b></p>
                   <p> The reason I say it's a fantasy is quite simple. I thought he would change, and he would respond when he is online. But he didn't. He still hasn't responded, despite being online for more than 5 hours now. And now that I re-accepted him on my friends list, it's going to be magnitudes harder to remove him again.</p>
                   <p> I'm still waiting for what he has to say. It's 11:16pm right now.</p>

                        </div>
                    <p> I think that's all we need to talk about today. I made it really, really clear. I agree, it's a bit bitchy. He's also being a bit bitchy. Saying that firstly <i> I have a need to be a better friend</i> is some utter bullshit. Secondly, that me <i> needing</i> to be a better friend is the root cause of his unresponsiveness? <b>What. The. Fuck.</b></p>
                    <p> Me saying that I didn't need him, I guess, was a bit mean. But he deserved it. <b> I don't need him. </b> In fact, I see nothing in him anymore. I used to want to be his good friend, but he doesn't deserve that anymore. He is so inherently flawed and full of himself to say that I have a need to be a better friend. That this need is part of a bigger issue and ruining our "friendship".</p>
                    <p> Now, to be honest, I <b> did enjoy</b> talking to him before. But that was because of a brainwashed view of him. When I had this amazing view of him of being a hero, everything, even waiting for days, was worth it. In the eyes of a normal person, which he 100% is, he did not treat me fairly. </p>
                    <p> So honestly, I'm probably stressing over this WAY more than him. Because he has a herd of sheep. I just have him. And he will never know how valuable he was to me‚Äîas the first really smart and nice person I met, who helped me when I had issues‚Äîbut it all fell down. Because it was a facade. And these memories, both the guillable and knowledgable ones, I will remember for a long time. üò≠</p>
