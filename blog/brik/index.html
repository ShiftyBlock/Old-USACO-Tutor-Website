                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p> October 17, 2020. </p>
                        <p>Honestly, I don't know why I'm restarting writing blogs.<p>
                        <p> It's not as if I can go write a blog, and suddenly I'm going to improve. But honestly going with the "flow" is literally nonsense for me, I don't touch USACO when I'm in a fucking flow.</p>      
                        <p> But, over the past 2 months, of being "relaxed", the following things have happened:</p>    
                        <ul>
                            <li> Parents call me lazy</li>
                            <li> I think I am lazy</li>
                            <li> I start up a trash tutoring service</li>
                            <li> I didn't improve</li>
                            <li> Even Brian Dean wants me to get better</li>
                            <li> I also really want to make camp this year and its not happening with the flow</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Honestly, I really love USACO but I also hate it so much when it's hard. I don't know how to perservere. Everyone around me: CodeTiger, Fishy15, even Elephant who's so bunched up with school work, are accelerating like rockets.</p>
                        <p> Just looking at your decision to do Edgenuity, what was it all for? Did you do it to make some nonsense money? Did you do it to waste around, watching youtube? <b>Or did you do it because you had a dream, and you wanted to work for that dream?</b> It's stupid to have no school and do nothing with that time. I really thought you were better than that.</p>
                        <p> Well, this is your first day. But more like an introduction. Day 0. </p>
                        <p> I think some important things to note on your odyssey:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Don't Dwell on Your Failures. Move ON.</li>
                            <li> It's OK to ask for help</li>
                            <li> Reading Editorial > Quitting</li>
                            <li> William Lin is still better than you</li>
                            <li> <b>If you want it enough, you'll work hard enough.</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> I think, all in all, I've learned a lot from my first intensive thing, and it was really hard. Now, I know its way easier said than done, but still. I believe in you. Just, don't give up. Don't let me (and BDean) down.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Day 1</h3>

                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>October 18, 2020</p>
                       <p>Okay, official "TMW Training", or more formally, "Torture Training". Day 1.</p>
                       <p> Firstly, for the fun part: here's my new desktop :)</p>
                     <!-- spoiler-->

                            <div>

                            <p>William Lin!</p>
                            <p>I have a crush on him :/ </p>
                            <p>Like, he's literally so cute.</p>
                            <p>Wouldn't you? D: </p>
                            <br>

                        <!-- end spoiler-->
                        <p> Okay, well that's all the fun stuff today.</p>
                        <p> I'd say, you did okay. It was actually really fun to solve IOI 2019 Shoes, and I'm still kind of an a happy-high right now. Like, damn, it's an IOI problem, from recently!</p>
                        <p> But, don't get ahead of yourself, haha. Your skill right now is still a 5.5-6.0 kind of thing, definitely not camp level yet.</p>
                        <p>I don't feel really different or really depressed or anything. I think the true art of TMW Training is honestly enjoying it. I know that tommorow, or some day later, I will be very sad and say "i cant solve anything", but I don't think that day is today.</p>
                        <p> Well, I guess it's probably important to deal with failures in a good way.</p>
                        <p> Then again, how can you do that?</p>
                        <p> Eh, whatever, oh well.</p>
                        <p> I guess I'll just do more problems tomorrow? It honestly feels kind of odd, having nothing bad to report on. Just, bliss. Such a weird feeling.</p>
                        <p> Regarding my social life:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> I spent about 30m editing William's Photo</li>
                            <li> Anthony Kung is gay</li>
                            <li> I wasted like 1h talking to Anthony today smh</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Yea, I guess I do have nothing to write about. That's all for Day 1!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="title"> Day 2</h3>
                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p> October 19, 2020</p>
                        <p> It's currently 2:30PM, and I only solved TypePrinter, a problem that I debugged for hours because <code> endl</code> is slower than <code>"\n"</code></p>
                        <p> Other than that problem, I haven't done anything else. And moreover, how do you "improve" fast? Like, am I even improving?</p>
                        <p> Well, actually, this question is pretty bullshit, so I'm going to hopefully not answer it. If I do, then you know I'm failing.</p>
                        <p>Okay, so I have 2 options now:</p>
                        <ol> 
                            <li>Solve Linear Garden</li>
                            <li>Go outside and cry</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p> I'm currently leaning to #2, but maybe that will change</p>
                        <p> Okay, update, 10:30PM</p>
                        <p> <b>As expected with ALL of your stupid DP problems, you were lazy and didn't fucking solve it</b></p>
                        <p> I'm honestly so disappointed in you, you spent 20 minutes watching a CP Guru video and you didn't actually solve problems -> the best way to get better.</p>
                        <p> Think about it like a fitness program. You can watch, read, listen, to all the tutorials in the world, but it's not helping you if you don't do it. <b> You aren't doing it.</b></p>
                        <p> Okay, enough with the "think about" bullshit. Just fucking do it. Like, why are you so annoying?</p>
                        <p> This was my day overview</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Solve Typewriter</li>
                            <li> Eat Lunch</li>
                            <li> Attempt Linear Garden -> Watch YT for 5 hours</li>
                            <li> Retry Linear Garden -> fail</li>
                            <li> Watch Galen Colin's "Roadmap" video</li>
                            <li> Be sad at how fast he improved, red in 1.5 years, even though I know I've gone down this fucking rabbit hole so many times it's stupid. <i> You know what, just fucking listen to Fishy, he's right. Others' successes don't undermine yours.</i></li>
                            <li>Be sad.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Day 2 of TMW Training is kind of a flop. You did 2.5 hours today, which is pretty decent, but also kind of trash.</p>
                        <p> See you tommorow. </p>
                        <button class="spoilerbutton button1"  value="Show" onclick="this.value=this.value=='Show'?'Hide':'Show';">Rant</button>
                        <div class="spoiler">
                            <div>

                            <p>My life is literally always just: solved problem? Yay. Didn't solve? Go to hell.</p>
                            <p>Accompanied with a stupid B- in Calculus from fucking Unit Summaries, I'm not feeling too good today. </p>
                            <p>Even then, what do I need to feel good? You're never satisfied. But you also never fucking put in the necessary effort to achieve your dreams. You are a joke. You are a a fraud. </p>
                            <p> Like seriously, if you genuinely want to be as great as William Lin, why don't you put in the effort that he did? You claim you have the passion, you claim that you're <i> always so busy</i>, you even claim that you'll be able to make camp this year, but where's the fucking evidence? Where's the proof behind the passion? <b>I didn't see you persist through Linear Garden today. Is that passion, or is it an infatuation?</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>You can look at all the successful people, or you can look at Fishy, or you can look at other smart people. What they all have in common is that they have passion. They love what they do, even if it's tough. They persist. What about YOU?</p>
                            <p> Do you even have passion? On paper it's so easy to say yes, but sometimes I even think the answer is no. Real passion comes from a heart-burning desire to get shit done, not a far-fetched dream of wanting to be great in a subject you've only touched for 1 year.</p>
